I need a basic website for the Pycelium project, and it should be dark themed: dark backgrounds with white text and purple buttons and other UI elements. I would like to host it as static html on Cloudflare Pages. It must have the following pages:
1) Home/landing page. This should have the pycelium-concept-1.jpg artwork (or something generated from it but very similar) as a background on the top half of the page, with the Pycelium-logo-white-transparent.png displayed prominently and centered, with the text "Building FOSS packages for distributed applications" below it. Below that will be a section with the title "Project Spotlight" and the subtitle "micropycelium", with a few sentences of placeholder text. Below that will be four cards that link to four pages: About, Projects, Goals, and Community; these should display in a single row for large screens and a 2x2 for medium or smaller screens.
2) About page. This will have the logo at the top but smaller than on the home page, followed by some text. Fill in with a paragraph of lorem ipsum placeholder text for now.
3) Projects page. This will have clickable cards that open modals when clicked: a 2x2 of cards with larger text for four major projects, followed by a 3-column grid of cards for the remaining projects. The cards should contain titles and short tag-lines, and the modal when opened will have a title with stylized links to PyPI and GitHub below it, then a content area where I will place short descriptions and further links. The 4 big cards should be titled "micropycelium", "tapescript", "sqloquent", and "netaio". The smaller cards should be titled "crdts", "packify", "merkleasy", "musig", "autodox", "flying-state-machines", "reclocks", "hrw", "credos", "bookchain", "simplebooks", "simple-hooks", and "crossconfig". Every project has a github link with the form "https://github.com/k98kurz/{project_name}". Every project except micropycelium has a pypi link with the form "https://pypi.org/project/{project_name}".
4) Goals page. This page should have a title and three sections with subtitles and content: "Decentralized Networking", "Distributed Logic", and "Universal Credit Network". The content can be placeholder text for now.
5) Community page. This will have the link to the Discord group invitation and a small text blurb.

There should be a navigation bar at the top (at the top of the page content, but not hovering -- I don't want it to continue showing when I scroll down) with links to the four pages. There should be a footer at the bottom with "Copyright 2025 - The Pycelium Corp." The font, nav bar, and footer should be consistent across all pages. Use a sans-serif font and tailwind css. It would be best for this to use some kind of framework/library that allows composition with the layout defined in a single file and shared across all pages.
